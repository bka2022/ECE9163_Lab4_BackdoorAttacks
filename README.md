Set data path = `"/content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/Lab4"` and upload the data in the following format 
```bash
├── data 
    └── cl // this is clean data 
        └── valid.h5 
        └── test.h5
    └── bd // this is poisoned data
        └── valid.h5

```
Also add the lab3 folder uploaded in the repo.
